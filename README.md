The MApp-IDEA (Monitoring App for Issue Detection and Prioritization) is an unsupervised method to detect issues, classify reviews in a risk matrix with levels of prioritization, and monitor the evolution of issues and risks over time. In practice, the MApp-IDEA (i) collects reviews automatically, (ii) detects issues, (iii) classifies issues in a risk matrix, and then (iv) models the temporal dynamics of issues and risks through time series to trigger alerts. 

We performed an empirical evaluation with approximately 5 million reviews, where we detected 230,000 issues and classified them into priority levels through a risk matrix. 

The results showed that with the risk matrix and temporal modeling, the MApp-IDEA prioritizes and identifies the upward trend of issues before becoming more critical, alerting the development team in advance. The results also showed that our unsupervised issue detection approach is competitive compared to state-of-the-art supervised methods.
